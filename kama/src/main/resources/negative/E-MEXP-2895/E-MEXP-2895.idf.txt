Protocol Description	mRNA expression data was normalised using NimbleGen's NimbleScan software which normalises the data by applying quantile normalisation, to generate normalised pair reports, followed by the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algoritm to generate Gene Calls.  	Microarrays were scanned according to Chapter 5: One-Color Array Scanning of NimbleGen Arrays User's Guide, Gene Expression Analysis<br>(Parameters: Scanning hardware = GenePix 4000B [Axon Instruments], Scanning software = GenePix Pro [Axon Instruments])	Pre-miR to miRNA542-5p and negative control 1 (a scrambled oligonucleotide) were obtained from Ambion (Austin, Texas). The Pre-miR and the negative control 1 were introduced into Kelly cells by reverse transfection (final concentration 30nM) using the transfection agent siPORT NeoFX (Ambion). Cell culture media was changed after 8 hours to remove the transfection reagent in an attempt to avoid toxicity which may be caused by NeoFX. Total RNA/miRNA was extracted 48 hours after transfection using miRNeasy kit(Qiagen, UK).	Kelly, SK-N-BE and SK-N-AS cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, U.K.).  The NGP cell line was obtained from Cancer Therapy &amp; Research Centre, San Antonio, Texas.  SK-N-AS cells were grown in EMEM supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids, 2mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin.  Kelly and NGP cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin.  SK-N-BE cells were grown in Ham's F12/EMEM supplemented with 0.5% non-essential amino acids, 1mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin.  All cell culture reagents were obtained from GIBCO.<br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, temperature unit = C)	Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using the miRNeasy Kit (QIAGEN, Cat. No.  217004), including DNase treatment (QIAGEN, Cat. No. 79254), as per manufacturer's instructions.   <br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)
