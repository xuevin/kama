Protocol Name	P-MTAB-16758	P-MTAB-16759
Protocol Description	RNA was extracted from the microdissected frozen tissue with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit and after QC with an Agilent system all samples with RIN > 4 were used for further evaluation. 100 ng of the RNA was subjected to the Affymetrix Two cycle amplification an labeling kit. (Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = RNA polymerases)	Samples were snap frozen after surgery and microdissected for gene expression profiling
